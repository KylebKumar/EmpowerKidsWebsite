        <h1 class="article-header">Our Mission</h1>
        <p class="article-text">In rural India, many children are unable to get a formal education due to economic and social barriers. As a native of India, Vivek Kumar experienced some of these problems firsthand, and when he was blessed with citizenship to the United States he knew he had to give back to help lift others up.</p>
        <p class="article-text">He founded the EmpowerKids foundation to address this issue by providing educational resources to students who were being left out of the system.</p>

        <h1 class="article-header">After School Tutoring</h1>
        <p class="article-text">Many students need extra support beyond what their communities can offer them. To fill this need, the EmpowerKids Foundation provides after-school tutoring to children ranging from ages 5-15. Our tutoring has a focus on gaining an English education from reading and writing, and also aims to give students a working understanding of computers and the internet.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Additionally, this program provides school supplies to any student who needs them, enabling any student, regardless of their economic situation, to take advantage of this opportunity. The program has reached over 400 students already, and with continued support for the organization it will reach many more.</p>

    <div id="BootcampSection" class="article">
        <h1 class="article-header">Residential School Bootcamp</h1>
        <p class="article-text">Underserved children, due their economic status, do not have resources to complete their education up to 12th grade. In the modern age, this is a huge problem as automation continues to replace unskilled labor with highly specialized tasks. To address this issue, the government started a program that offers children who meet certain educational criteria a free, government-sponsored education.</p>
        <p class="article-text">However, many students are unable to meet these standards on their own. Our program, with the help of volunteer engineering students from NIT Jamshedpur, gives students the skills they need to qualify for this program. In the past two years alone, 12 of our students have been accepted into this prestigious government program.</p>
